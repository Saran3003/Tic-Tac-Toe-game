//The Tic Tac Toe game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a classic and interactive web implementation of the iconic two-player game. The HTML structure defines a 3x3 grid as the game board, each cell represented by a styled div. The CSS styles provide a clean and visually appealing layout, making it user-friendly.

JavaScript controls the game logic, handling player turns, checking for a winner after each move, and determining when the game ends in a tie. The game is designed to be intuitive, allowing players to click on empty cells to make their moves, with alerts signaling the winner or a tie. This simple yet engaging project demonstrates the synergy of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating an enjoyable user experience for a timeless game.

Its a new way of playing it.
